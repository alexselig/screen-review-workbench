# ScreenCheck

A localhost-only Bauhausian workbench for reviewing live application screens
and versioned captures with durable pin feedback.

The repository contains generic tooling and example data only. Project source,
captures, injected headers, feedback, and identities live in ignored local
configuration under `~/.screencheck`.

> **Renamed from Screen Review Workbench.** Existing data keeps working: if
> `~/.screencheck` does not exist yet, ScreenCheck reads
> `~/.screen-review-workbench`. To move it, stop the server and run
> `mv ~/.screen-review-workbench ~/.screencheck`. The old `SCREEN_REVIEW_DATA`,
> `SCREEN_REVIEW_PROJECTS` and `SCREEN_REVIEW_URL` variables still work, and
> unsaved drafts and panel settings in the browser carry over automatically.

**Site:** https://alexselig.github.io/screencheck/ (feature tour
with screenshots).

## Install / Run

```bash
npx screencheck serve --open
```

The server binds to `http://127.0.0.1:4173` (`--port` to change it) and
records itself in `~/.screencheck/server.json`, so the other commands find it
without a port. Throwaway servers (demos, scripts) can set `SCREENCHECK_RECORD=0`
so they don't take that slot from your real one. Node 22 or later.

| Command                                              | What it does                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `screencheck serve [--port 4173] [--open]`           | Start the review server                                          |
| `screencheck status`                                 | Print the running server's origin, or "not running"              |
| `screencheck reply --project <id> ...`               | List open comments or reply to one (see below)                   |
| `screencheck mcp [--url <origin>] [--author <name>]` | Run the MCP server on stdio for coding agents                    |
| `screencheck capture <url> --out <file>`             | Full-page screenshot without mid-page footers (needs Playwright) |

`screencheck --help` lists them; `screencheck <command> --help` shows options.

### Develop

```bash
npm install
npm run dev     # Vite with HMR on http://127.0.0.1:4173
npm test
npm run build   # dist/client plus the bundled CLI in dist/cli.js
```

## Current implementation

- Wide and compact numbered navigation with hover/focus expansion and pinning.
- Fullscreen review: a slim numbered screen strip on the left that expands to
  names on hover, and a feedback edge panel on the right.
- Stable screen manifests, registered from local JSON files.
- Screen pins placed on an aspect-locked screen frame, so they stay put at any
  window size. Each comment card leads with the same numbered dot as its pin.
- Free-text tags with suggested P0/P1/P2 priorities (one at a time; new pins
  default to P1), a status of Backlog, In progress, Fixed, Verified or
  Won't fix, autosaved notes and two-step delete. Fixed pins turn teal with a
  check badge and Verified pins are solid teal, so new feedback stands out from
  what has already been addressed.
- **Threads close the loop.** Each comment keeps an ordered thread of messages
  from the agent and the reviewer. Whoever fixes a comment (usually an agent)
  replies with what was done, or why not, and can set its status in the same
  call. The collapsed card shows the latest message; the editor shows the whole
  thread, each message with its author, time and any status change it made,
  plus a **Reply** box for the reviewer. Closing a comment as Fixed or Won't fix
  from the editor needs a reply. Threads appear in exports in order.
- **Verify step.** A Fixed card shows **Verify** and **Reopen**. Verify moves it
  to Verified; Reopen moves it back to Backlog and asks why, adding the reason
  to the thread. Only a person sets Verified: the server refuses it unless the
  request carries `x-screencheck-actor: reviewer`, which the browser sends and
  agents do not.
- **Export** in the action bar opens a dialog: Markdown or JSON, all screens or
  this screen only, and which statuses to include. Exports are deterministic,
  state their scope, and keep on-screen pin numbers.
- The feedback panel chunks comments by status, then by priority. Empty chunks
  are hidden and untagged comments sit under their status with no heading.
  A card being edited stays where it is while you type, even after autosave,
  retagging or a status change; it moves to its new group when collapsed.
  A new comment always starts in Backlog and keeps the compact create form
  through its first autosave, so the editor never grows under your cursor;
  the status picker appears once you reopen it.
  Each status section has a **Hide pins / Show pins** switch on its right;
  Fixed and Verified pins are hidden by default and the choice is remembered
  per browser.
- **Approve screen** is pinned to the foot of the feedback panel. One click
  approves the screen (teal, "Screen approved"); click again to unapprove.
  If the screen still has Fixed comments nobody has verified, the click asks
  first ("1 fix not verified. Approve anyway?").
  Approvals are saved per version and screen in `approvals.json`. Approved
  screens carry a teal check left of their number in the screen index, expanded,
  collapsed and fullscreen. The open-comment count is a matching orange badge
  in the same spot. Numbers stay dead center; badges hang off their left edge,
  and a screen that is approved and still has open comments stacks the check
  above the count so both fit the collapsed rail.
- A **Showing** strip above each capture says exactly what it shows (for
  example "Step 3 of 5, manual path selected"). Click it to edit; Enter saves,
  Esc cancels. Text is saved per version and screen in `captions.json`; a
  screen's optional manifest `description` is the default, and clearing an
  edit restores it.
- Older feedback files are migrated on read: priority Blocking/Important/Polish
  becomes P0/P1/P2, the category becomes a tag, and a single `reply` becomes
  the first message of the thread. Files are written with `schemaVersion: 2`;
  a file without it is read as version 1 and only rewritten on the next change.
- Responsive layout: at 900px and below, screens become a numbered strip and
  the feedback panel stacks under the canvas.
- Real captures: registered projects are read from
  `~/.screencheck/projects/*.json` (override with
  `SCREENCHECK_PROJECTS`) and each screen's capture is shown at full width.
  The frame takes each capture's own proportions (never stretched to the
  registered viewport), so tall captures make the page longer; the page is the
  scroll area, the screen
  list keeps its place, and the feedback panel follows along.
- A fixed action bar keeps the fullscreen toggle (left), Prev/Next and the
  current screen (centre), and **Export** and **Add feedback** (right) in reach at the bottom
  of the window. The address bar records the project,
  version, and screen, so a reload or shared link opens the same place.

### Keyboard

| Keys           | Action                                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| ⌘F / Ctrl+F    | Add feedback (replaces the browser's find in this app) |
| ← / → or [ / ] | Previous / next screen (ignored while typing)          |
| Esc            | Cancel placing a pin                                   |

- Atomic file storage with serialized mutations, conflict checks, and restart
  recovery.

### Where feedback is stored

Feedback is written to disk by the server, never only to the browser:

```
~/.screencheck/feedback/<projectId>/feedback.json
```

Set `SCREENCHECK_DATA` to use another folder (useful for testing). The
server prints the folder it is using on startup.

Feedback records carry `thread: [{id, author, role, note, at, status?}]`
(`role` is `reviewer` or `agent`; `status` is the change that message made)
and a derived `reply: {note, author, at}`, the latest agent message, for older
clients. In a PATCH:

- `reply: {note, author?}` appends an agent message (author defaults to
  `Agent`). `reply: null` removes the most recent agent message.
- `message: {note, author?, role?}` appends a message; `role` defaults to
  `reviewer`. Send `reply` or `message`, not both.
- The server stamps each message's `id` and `at`. If the same patch changes
  `status`, the message records the new status.
- Moving to Fixed or Won't fix needs a `reply` or `message` in the same patch.
- `status: "VERIFIED"` returns `403` unless the request carries
  `x-screencheck-actor: reviewer`. The same rule applies to create and import.

Every mutation must carry a loopback `Origin` header and a JSON body (1 MB
max); requests with a non-loopback `Host` header are refused. If
`feedback.json` cannot be parsed, the API returns `500` and the UI shows the
error with a Retry button — it never treats a damaged file as empty or
overwrites it.

Feedback saved by earlier builds in browser `localStorage` is imported on first
load. The browser copy is removed only after every record is accepted; anything
unreadable is left in place and reported. Project registrations, captures,
feedback, and injected headers must remain outside Git.

## Closing the loop (for agents)

After working through exported feedback, an agent answers each comment with
`screencheck reply`, which talks to the running ScreenCheck server (found
through `~/.screencheck/server.json`, or pass `--url` / `--port`):

```bash
# Open comments, tab-separated: id, version/screen pin N, status, tags, note
npx screencheck reply --project shop --list

# Say what was done and mark it Fixed (or --status wont-fix with the reason)
npx screencheck reply --project shop \
  --id <feedbackId> --status fixed --author Copilot \
  --note "Moved the footer to the end of the page."
```

From a clone, `node scripts/reply.mjs` still works with the same flags.

`--status` accepts `fixed`, `wont-fix`, `in-progress` or `backlog` and may be
left out to reply without moving the comment. Each reply is added to the
comment's thread; `--clear` removes the latest agent reply. Agents cannot mark
a comment Verified: they set Fixed and the reviewer verifies it in ScreenCheck.
Markdown exports list each comment's `id` so the agent can address it; if the
reviewer edits a comment at the same moment, the script re-reads and retries
once.

## MCP server

Agents that speak MCP (Copilot CLI, Claude Code, VS Code) can read and answer
feedback directly. The MCP server runs on stdio and is a thin client over the
HTTP API above: it never reads feedback files itself, and it only talks to a
ScreenCheck on loopback (`127.0.0.1`, `localhost` or `[::1]`).

It finds the running server on its own: `--url`, then `SCREENCHECK_URL`, then
`~/.screencheck/server.json` (written by `npm run dev`), then port 4173. It
looks this up on every call, so it can start before ScreenCheck does; until
then each tool says ScreenCheck isn't running.

| Tool              | What it does                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `list_projects`   | Projects, versions and screens, with open-comment counts                                                                                                       |
| `list_feedback`   | Comments with pin number, screen, status, tags, note, latest reply and pin position. Filters: `project`, `version`, `screen`, `status`, `tag`, `includeClosed` |
| `get_comment`     | One comment in full, the screen's caption, and a crop of the capture around the pin with the pin circled (`fullCapture: true` for the whole screen)            |
| `reply`           | Answer a comment (`note`) and optionally set `status`; retries once if the reviewer edited it meanwhile                                                        |
| `set_status`      | Change status without a note (closing as fixed or won't fix still needs `reply`)                                                                               |
| `approval_status` | Per-screen approval and open comments by priority for a version, e.g. `7/9 approved, 3 open (1 P0)`                                                            |

Statuses take the friendly names `backlog`, `in-progress`, `fixed` and
`wont-fix`. Agents can't set `verified`; only a reviewer can. Each project's
Markdown export is also a resource (`screencheck://project/<id>/feedback.md`),
and the `fix_open_feedback` prompt walks an agent through the open P0 and P1
comments. Replies are signed `Agent` unless the tool call passes `author` or
the server is started with `--author <name>` (or `SCREENCHECK_AUTHOR`).

**Copilot CLI** (`~/.copilot/mcp-config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "screencheck": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["tsx", "/path/to/screencheck/src/mcp/main.ts"],
      "tools": ["*"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Claude Code:**

```bash
claude mcp add screencheck -- npx tsx /path/to/screencheck/src/mcp/main.ts
```

**VS Code** (`.vscode/mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "screencheck": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["tsx", "/path/to/screencheck/src/mcp/main.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Register a project

Each project is one JSON file in `~/.screencheck/projects/` (or
`SCREENCHECK_PROJECTS`). Captures stay wherever they already live; each
version points at its folder:

```json
{
  "id": "shop",
  "name": "Shop",
  "versions": [
    { "id": "build-42", "captureRoot": "/path/to/captures/build-42" }
  ],
  "screens": [
    {
      "id": "checkout",
      "ordinal": 1,
      "title": "Checkout",
      "group": "Buy",
      "description": "Step 2 of 3, saved card",
      "capturePath": "checkout.png",
      "viewport": { "width": 1440, "height": 1000 }
    }
  ]
}
```

A capture must sit inside its version's `captureRoot`. To register a project
from its own manifests, keep a small importer script beside the registrations
rather than in this repository.

## Capturing long pages

Playwright's `fullPage` screenshot grows the capture, not the viewport, so a
footer or action bar with `position: fixed; bottom: 0` (or a stuck
`position: sticky; bottom: 0`) is painted at the bottom of the _first screen_,
in the middle of a long page. For a single shot, run
`npx screencheck capture <url> --out shot.png [--width 1440 --height 1000]
[--wait-for <selector>]`. Capture scripts should use the helper instead:

```ts
import { captureFullPage } from "screencheck/capture";

await captureFullPage(page, { path: "capture.webp", type: "webp" });
```

It moves bottom-anchored bars (at most half the viewport tall) to the end of the
document, takes the full-page shot, then restores their inline styles exactly.
Headers, full-screen dialogs, and pages shorter than the viewport are left
alone. Apps that scroll an inner container (a `100vh` body with its own
scroller) are not covered; capture those by scrolling the container instead.

## Element map

When `captureFullPage` is given a `path`, it also writes an element map beside
the capture: `checkout.png` gets `checkout.elements.json`. It records the
visible, meaningful elements after the footer adjustments, so the boxes line up
with the full-page shot:

- interactive elements (links, buttons, fields, anything with a `role` or
  `tabindex`), headings, images, `header`/`nav`/`main`/`footer`/`aside` and
  labelled sections and forms, anything with `data-testid`, and blocks that
  hold text directly;
- for each: its box as fractions of the capture (like pin coordinates), role,
  accessible name (120 characters at most), tag, `data-testid`, a short
  selector (test id, then id, then a short CSS path) and, when it can tell,
  the source file.

Hidden, zero-size and `opacity: 0` elements are left out, and a page keeps at
most 2000 (interactive and tagged elements first). Pass `elements: false` to
skip the map or `elements: { path }` to write it elsewhere; the map is also
returned as `result.elements`.

A pin then names the element under it (the smallest box containing it): the
comment card shows `↳ button "Continue to vehicle" · Footer.tsx:42`, and
exports add `Element: button "Continue to vehicle" (src/booking/Footer.tsx:42)`
in Markdown and an `element` object in JSON. Screens without a map simply show
nothing. The shared helpers live in `src/shared/elements.ts`
(`elementMapSchema`, `resolvePinElement`, `describeElement`).

**Source files** are best effort, read in this order, and never required:

1. Attributes on the element or its nearest annotated ancestor:
   `data-source="src/booking/Footer.tsx:42:7"`, react-dev-inspector's
   `data-inspector-relative-path` / `-line` / `-column`,
   `data-source-file` / `-line`, Sentry's `data-sentry-source-file` and
   `data-sentry-component`, or `data-component`.
2. React development builds: `_debugSource` (React 18 and earlier) gives file,
   line and component; React 19 gives the component name and the file from its
   dev stack (no line, since dev-server stacks are not source-mapped).
3. Vue development builds: the component's `__file` and name.
4. Svelte development builds: `__svelte_meta.loc`.

To opt a build in, capture a development build, or add a compile-time plugin
that stamps JSX with a source attribute: for example
`@react-dev-inspector/babel-plugin` (Babel),
`@sentry/babel-plugin-component-annotate`, or an SWC plugin that writes
`data-source="file:line"`. Keep it out of production builds.

## Project site

`docs/` is the GitHub Pages site. Its screenshots come from a made-up ferry app
("Tidewater") so no real project appears in them. To regenerate them:

```bash
node scripts/site/build-shots.mjs          # writes docs/assets/*.png
node scripts/site/build-shots.mjs --serve  # leaves the seeded demo running on :4196
```

The script renders each demo screen through `captureFullPage` (which also
writes each screen's element map; the demo markup carries `data-source`
attributes so cards show a file), registers them
in a temporary folder, starts a server on port 4196 with temporary data, seeds
the comments, replies and approvals through the API, and captures the shots
listed in `scripts/site/shots.mjs`. Nothing touches `~/.screencheck`.
